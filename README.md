# imageSorterByGeoTagging
This script can be run from a root directory of images and searches for These images in folders and in subfolders. These images are then scanned for 'GPSInfo' in the metadata and sorted in folders based on a precision number that determines different locations.  Tweak the "precision" parameter to improve filtering of locations
